# A guide to sustainability focused projects on Hedera

## Introduction
*This article is not a comprehensive “sustainability for beginners” guide. It’s more of a very brief (as possible) **first step** towards a guide for ecosystem-developers who wants to particpate in sustainability markets on Hedera. Since this area is growing at a pretty crazy pace (I'm personally aware of 25+ projects on Hedera today) **the information below is likely to go out of date relatively quickly**. We'll try to keep it up to date via [pull-requests](https://github.com/dubgeis/SustainabilityEcosystem/pulls) and [issues](https://github.com/dubgeis/SustainabilityEcosystem/issues). And I **hope the platforms themselves will add relevant information, “Statement of Values”, and roadmaps to their own site**.*

NOTE: ALL BELOW IS NOT ACCURATE AND THERE FOR FORMATTING AS AN EXAMPLE
RECDeFi (i.e. selling digital art on the blockchain) is worth at least $150M - and this excludes some of the largest marketplaces like [opensea.io](http://opensea.io), (and this figure is quite heavily skewed of course, with the top artists earning the most [[1](https://cryptoart.io/artists)]).

Selling work on a blockchain can be a technically challenging task. For this reason, many platforms and websites have emerged, aiming to make this process as seamless and easy as possible for artists. Unfortunately, currently many of these websites are based on the Ethereum blockchain, which is very inefficient and ecologically costly by design. E.g. selling just a single-edition artwork on Ethereum has a carbon footprint starting at around 100 KgCO2, which is equivalent to a 1 hour flight (and depending on the platform, can reach a long-haul flight) [[2](https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053)]. Selling an edition of 100 works has a carbon footprint of over 10 tonnes CO2, which is more than the per capita annual footprint of someone in the EU - including all emissions from industry and trade [[3](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#co2-embedded-in-trade)].

But there are more sustainable routes emerging. As the CryptoArt NFT market is exploding in a gold-rush style free-for-all, there is a lack of clear information on the ecological impact of different approaches to NFTs. The purpose of this guide is to help CryptoArtists who are interested in exploring more sustainable alternatives. Currently, these more sustainable platforms do not have the volume of their unsustainable counterparts (i.e. the Ethereum-based platforms). For this reason, collectors and sales are likely to be significantly lower too on the more sustainable alternatives. However, hopefully as more artists migrate to these emerging waters, this can encourage platforms, developers, investors and collectors, to bridge to develop more **ecologically friendly and transparent platforms**.


**We are also hoping the platforms themselves will be more transparent on the matter, and we can eventually retire this document**. However, at the time of writing, not a single platform has publicly acknowledged the issue on their website. When they do, the relevant links will be included below.

## NFT Platforms & Marketplaces
These are the websites that you would use to upload, ‘mint’ and sell your works.
For sake of simplicity, we can say that from an ecological perspective, Ethereum (which uses PoW), is the worst (unless sidechains or L2 scaling is implemented).

Platforms using different blockchains (e.g. using PoS, PoA etc) will generally be hundreds times more efficient. For those wishing to not incur the immense footprints of Ethereum, look for - and support - alternatives. Sales may be lower for now (see the **Risks** section at the end). This document doesn’t aim to give advice, instead it is a **first step** in collecting this information in one place.

Hopefully if there is enough demand for **sustainable and transparent platforms**, this can encourage developers, investors and collectors to invest in and develop these more ecologically friendly alternatives and grow the market. (And hopefully the community can provide more feedback - perhaps in the [issues](https://github.com/memo/eco-nft/issues)).

### Supply Platforms
#### [RECDeFi](https://hedera.com/users/recdefi) - RECDeFi is an automated, decentralized, and scalable marketplace that accelerates investment in clean energy and climate solutions by making it faster, cheaper, and easier to trade renewable energy credits, carbon offsets, and other environmental commodities. RECDeFi provides time-stamped asset-linked digital renewable energy credits that enable buyers to match electricity consumption with renewable energy generation on a 24/7 basis to reduce carbon emissions associated with energy use.
- [recdefi.com](recdefi.com)
- Primary Goal: **Digital MRV (REC)**/**Automated Market**
- Open Source MRV Protocol
- Major Partnerships: TBA

#### Dovu - open marketplace for digital art
- [dovu.earth](dovu.earth)
- Primary Goal: **Digital MRV (Offsets)**/**DeFi Market (Uniber)** (by CryptoKitties folks, used by one of the largest NFT platforms, [NBA topshots](https://www.nbatopshot.com/))
- Major Partnerships: Jaguar Landrover


### Demand Platforms

## Blockchains
There’s not much an individual CryptoArtist can do with the following information without a platform (i.e. website and marketplace) using these blockchains, or without coding everything themselves. But the list is still included here as a guide, in case you hear these words and wonder what they are:

---

## Risks
- Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile [[4](https://coinmarketcap.com/)], and their values can dramatically fall (or rise). E.g. if you sell a NFT for 1 ETH, which is currently worth ~\$1600, the value of ETH could later drop to a few hundred $ in a few months, or even in a few weeks (alternatively, it could rise to two or three thousand $$ too).
- This becomes potentially even more risky (or potentially more rewarding) with cryptocurrencies that have a much smaller market cap (e.g. NEAR, XTZ, AVAX etc), which could die and drop to zero (or go to the moon) in a few weeks.
- Please act responsibly. Seek financial advice if need be (preferably not from YouTube, TikTok, Elon Musk or Chamath Palihapitiya).
- The smaller blockchains are likely to have fewer collectors. So expect smaller sales on these platforms. (Though as more people start to use these blockchains for NFTs the prices will likely rise with demand).
